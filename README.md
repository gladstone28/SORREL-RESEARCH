Sorrel (Hibiscus sabdariffa) is typically ready for harvest about 6-8 weeks after planting, depending on the growing conditions. Here’s how you can determine the right time to reap your Sorrel:

1. Signs of Maturity: The leaves and stems of the Sorrel plant are usually the first to show signs of maturity. You'll notice that the flowers start to turn into red, fleshy calyces (the part you harvest). These calyces will be a bright red color when fully ripe.

2. When to Harvest: Harvest when the calyces have fully developed and turned red or dark red. If you wait too long, they may become too dry or lose some of their flavor. Aim to harvest when they are still firm and fleshy, with no signs of wilting or drying.

3. Time of Day: It's best to harvest Sorrel in the morning when the plant is fresh and not stressed by the sun. This helps to preserve the quality of the calyces.

4. Method: Cut the calyces from the plant with a sharp knife or pruning shears, ensuring to leave some of the stem attached to avoid damaging the plant. The leaves of the plant can also be used for other purposes but are typically not the primary part harvested.

5. Post-Harvest Care: After harvesting, you can use the Sorrel calyces to make drinks, jams, or even for medicinal purposes. If you don’t plan to use them immediately, you can store them by drying or freezing them.

If you’re growing Sorrel in your backyard, you should be able to harvest multiple times throughout the growing season. Keep an eye on the plants, and as soon as the calyces are ready, they’ll give you the green light to harvest!
