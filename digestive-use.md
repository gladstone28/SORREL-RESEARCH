To prepare Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces for digestive health (item 5), one of the most common methods is to make hibiscus tea. Here's a simple recipe for preparing hibiscus tea, which can be beneficial for digestion:

Ingredients:
1-2 tablespoons of dried hibiscus calyces (you can adjust the amount to taste)
2 cups of water
Honey, ginger, or lemon (optional, for added flavor and health benefits)
Instructions:
Boil the Water: Start by bringing 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan or kettle.

Prepare the Calyces: While the water is heating up, measure out 1-2 tablespoons of dried hibiscus calyces. You can adjust the amount based on how strong you want the flavor of the tea.

Steep the Calyces: Once the water is boiling, pour it over the dried hibiscus calyces in a heatproof teapot or bowl. Allow the calyces to steep for about 5-10 minutes. The longer you let it steep, the stronger and more flavorful the tea will be.

Strain the Tea: After the calyces have steeped to your liking, strain the tea to remove the dried flowers.

Add Optional Ingredients: If you'd like, you can sweeten the tea with a little honey, add a slice of fresh ginger for an extra digestive boost, or squeeze in some lemon juice for added flavor and vitamin C.

Serve: Pour the tea into a cup, and enjoy it either hot or cold. For a cold option, allow the tea to cool down to room temperature and refrigerate it. Serve it over ice for a refreshing, digestive-friendly drink.
