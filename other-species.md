Yes, there are other species of Hibiscus that are commonly referred to as "sorrel" in various regions, but Hibiscus sabdariffa is the most well-known for its use in beverages, jams, and culinary applications. Here are a few other species of Hibiscus that might be referred to as sorrel in different contexts:

Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (Chinese Hibiscus or Tropical Hibiscus): This species is a popular ornamental plant with large, colorful flowers. While it is not typically used for culinary purposes like Hibiscus sabdariffa, in some regions, the young leaves and flowers of this plant are used in traditional dishes, often in salads or as a garnish.

Hibiscus acetosella (Red-leafed Hibiscus): Sometimes called "false sorrel" due to its sour-tasting leaves, this plant has deep red or purple leaves. It is often used in gardening for its decorative value, but the leaves are sometimes used in cooking, especially in African cuisine, for their tart flavor.

Hibiscus mutabilis (Confederate Rose): This plant, native to China, is an ornamental species often grown for its large, showy flowers. Although not typically used in food or drinks, its petals have occasionally been used in folk medicine.

Hibiscus calyphyllus (Ugandan Sorrel): This species is sometimes used in Uganda for its edible leaves, which are used in local stews and soups. It is not as widely known or cultivated as Hibiscus sabdariffa, but it is an example of another species of Hibiscus that may be referred to as sorrel in some cultures.

Though all these species belong to the Hibiscus genus, Hibiscus sabdariffa is the one that is most commonly associated with the term "sorrel" when it comes to culinary use, particularly in beverages like the popular sorrel drink made from its calyces.
